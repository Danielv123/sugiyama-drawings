		Follows a practical guide:
		<h2>drawing</h2>
		<p style="width:70%;">
			In this page you can upload a graph (written by its edges) in the following CSV format:
			<code>
				<br><br><br>source,target
				<br>b,a
				<br>b,c
				<br>c,e
				<br>e,f
				<br>f,b
				<br>a,f
				<br>a,d
				<br>d,b
				<br>c,f<br><br><br>
			</code>
			The file must necessarily be in the 'CSVs' folder. The display of the graph can highlight the inverted edges in red if we had used a heuristic to get it. For example this is the csv output file product by dfs-based heuristic. The value 0 shows that the edge has been inverted:
			<code>
				<br><br><br>source,target,value
				<br>b,a,1
				<br>b,c,1
				<br>a,f,1
				<br>a,d,1
				<br>c,e,1
				<br>f,c,0
				<br>f,e,0
				<br>b,f,0
				<br>b,d,0<br><br><br>
			</code>
		</p>
		<h2>heuristics: dfs, leftwards, greedy</h2>
		<p style="width:70%;">
			In the follows GitHub Readme there is an overview about the heuristics I implemented:

					link to github README.md
				</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			In dfs, leftwards, and greedy pages, we can select the csv file, confirm file pushing 'ok', when we push 'execute' we obtain a new representation without cycle of the graph. It's possible export a new csv (graph without cycle) using the form below.
