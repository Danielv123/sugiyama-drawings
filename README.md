###an overview on hierarchical graph
In a hierarchical drawing of a directed graph:
* Nodes are drawn on a collection of horizontal lines (levels or layers) 
* Edges are represented with polylines (polygonal chains)

Hierarchical drawings are used to represent precedence relationships. Applications include: computer network visualization, web maps visualization, visualization of biologic maps, social networks visualization, others...

###sugiyama methodology
Layered graph drawing or hierarchical graph drawing is a type of graph drawing in which the vertices of a directed graph are drawn in horizontal rows or layers with the edges generally directed downwards.It is also known as Sugiyama-style graph drawing after Kozo Sugiyama, who first developed this drawing style.

The four steps of the methodology:

1. Cycle removal: temporarily reverts the direction of some edges in such a way to have an acyclic input graph, this step is not needed if the input graph has no directed cycle.
2. Level assignment assigns nodes to levels (hence determining their y-coordinate) the graph is changed in such a way that each edge connects nodes on adjacent levels: this is obtained by introducing dummy nodes.
3. Crossing reduction: sorts the nodes of each level in such a way to reduce the number of edge crossings.
4. X-coordinate assignment: assigns an x-coordinate (hence a placement) to each node, dummy nodes are replaced with bends.

Several alternative algorithms and heuristics are nowadays available for each step.

###goal
I'm going to explore the various alternatives (heuristics) for the removal of the direct cycles of a directed graph, th goal is reducing the number of edges that have been inverted.

I would compare the following heuristics:

1. Heuristic based on a depth-first search
2. Greedy approach proposed by Eades (see resources)
3. Other heuristics that I produce

###focus on cycle removal
Simply we have a graph G with a set of edege E and a set of vertices V (nodes), the problem is the following:

```
INPUT:    A directed graph G
OUTPUT:   A directed acyclic graph (DAG) Gâ€™
TARGET:   Reverse the direction of a small subset of the edges of G
```

If G=(V,E) is a directed graph and R is a set of edges, G-rev(R) is the graph obtained by reversing the edges in R. We would like to reverse a set of edges R, our target is obtain a G-rev(R) such that G-rev(R) is acyclic and |R| is minimum.

###feedback set vs feedback arc set
A set R of edges of a directed graph G=(V,E) is a **feedback set** if G-rev(R) is acyclic, whereas a **feedback arc set** is a set of edges whose removal makes the graph acyclic.

*Feedback set and feedback arc set are related but different concepts removing all edges of a cycle makes it trivially acyclic, reversing all edges of a cycle only changes its direction*
